    <h3>I used a nice light sauce on this iconic special occasion dish--lobster thermidor--rather than the thick, cheesy sauce popular in the '80s. Lobster is sweet and rich tasting on its own, so the lighter sauce makes so much sense. And what's even better, you can prep these ahead of time and just pop them in the oven when your guests arrive!</h3>

        <strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) lobster tails</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>

            <li>1 ½ cups diced mushrooms (Optional)</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons fine dried bread crumbs</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon cherry extract</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>Steps</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut bottom shell of lobster tails using kitchen shears along each side where it meets the top shell; do not remove the shell at this point.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place lobster tails cut side down in the butter. Cook, covered, about 3 minutes. Turn lobster tails over (they are curved so will lean to 1 side); cover and cook 1 minute. Lean them to the other side; cover and cook 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; add shallots and pinch of salt. Cook and stir until pan starts to deglaze and shallots soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook stir until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Add flour; stir until mushrooms are coated and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in cognac; use a kitchen torch to flame cognac to burn off alcohol. This will take just a few seconds. Add milk; cook and stir until pan is completely deglazed and milk begins to thicken and turn bubbly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in creme fraiche. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking pan with crinkled up foil. Make 4 channel-like indentations in the foil to hold and stabilize the lobster tails as they bake.</li>
        </ol>
